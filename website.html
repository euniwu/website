        <p id = "biop">My name is Eunice Wu, I'm currently seventeen and attending Cardozo High School. I will be a senior in the next school year.
          I'm not looking forward to applying to colleges because it seems like a long process and the wait for the results would be long.
        When I grow up, I would like to major in finance, but incase I fail there, my back up plan would be management or other forms of business.
        And if I fail there too, then my last option would be law. Why not become a doctor? Well because I'm not trying to accidentally kill a person.
        If I fail in all these areas, then I guess I'll resort to being a hobo because what's left to do when you have failed at everything. </p>
