  <h1> Eunice Wu </h1>
  <h2>Bio:</h2>
      
  <p>My name is Eunice Wu, I'm currently seventeen and attending Cardozo High School. I will be a senior in the next school year.
      I'm not looking forward to applying to colleges because it seems like a long process and the wait for the results would be long.
     When I grow up, I would like to major in finance, but incase I fail there, my back up plan would be management or other forms of business.
     And if I fail there too, then my last option would be law. Why not become a doctor? Well because I'm not trying to accidentally kill a person.
     If I fail in all these areas, then I guess I'll resort to being a hobo. </p>
  <h2>Likes: </h2>
      <p>I love reading and watching random animal videos on the internet  </p>
  <h2> Dislikes:</h2>
    <p> I hate any type of snakes or lizards, they are just too slimy and gross. For god sake they slither around poking their tounges out</p>
  <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
      <p> I used to play the violin but I hated it.</p>
